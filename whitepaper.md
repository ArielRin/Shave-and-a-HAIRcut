## 3. Tokenomics

Tokenomics are the lifeblood of any cryptocurrency, defining its economic model, incentives, and sustainability. HAIR employs a structured tokenomics model to balance growth, rewards, and community trust.

### 3.1 Transaction Fees

HAIR implements a dual-layered fee structure that applies during buying and selling transactions:

- **Initial Buy Tax:** 20%
- **Final Buy Tax:** 2% (after a certain number of buys)
- **Initial Sell Tax:** 20%
- **Final Sell Tax:** 3% (after a certain number of sells)

These taxes are designed to support various aspects of the token's ecosystem, including marketing and liquidity.

### 3.2 Fee Allocation

The collected taxes are allocated to designated wallets to fund the token's growth and operational costs:

- **Marketing Wallet:** Receives 50% of the collected fees.
- **Launch Marketing Wallet:** Receives 50% of the collected fees.

These allocations ensure continuous funding for promotional activities, partnerships, and other growth strategies.

### 3.3 Tax Reduction Mechanism

To encourage early participation and reward long-term holders, HAIR incorporates a tax reduction mechanism:

- **Buy Tax Reduction:** After **25 buy transactions**, the buy tax reduces from 20% to 2%.
- **Sell Tax Reduction:** After **25 sell transactions**, the sell tax reduces from 20% to 3%.

This phased reduction fosters a dynamic trading environment while minimizing fees for active and loyal participants.

## 4. Security & Access Control

Ensuring the security of the token and its ecosystem is paramount. HAIR incorporates multiple layers of security and controlled access to maintain integrity and trust.

### 4.1 Ownership & Sentinels

- **Ownership:** The deployer of the HAIR contract is designated as the **Owner**, possessing exclusive rights to execute critical administrative functions.

- **Sentinels:** While the contract owner is inherently a sentinel, **sentinels** are special addresses with elevated permissions. Currently, only the owner is set as a sentinel, allowing them to:
  - Remove transaction limits.
  - Adjust fee percentages.
  - Perform other administrative actions.

### 4.2 Safeguards

- **SafeMath Library:** Utilized to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows, ensuring secure mathematical operations.

- **Modifiers:** Access to sensitive functions is restricted using modifiers like `onlyOwner` and `onlyOwnerOrSentinel`, ensuring only authorized entities can execute critical operations.

---

## 5. Trading & Liquidity

Facilitating smooth trading and maintaining liquidity are crucial for the token's success. HAIR employs strategic mechanisms to achieve these objectives.

### 5.1 Opening Trading

- **Trading Control:** Trading is initially disabled to allow for setup and liquidity provisioning. Only the contract owner can enable trading.

- **Enabling Trading:** Once the owner calls the `openTrading` function:
  - The contract sets up the Uniswap V2 Router.
  - Creates a liquidity pair with ETH.
  - Adds liquidity by transferring 67% of the contract's token balance and the ETH balance to the liquidity pool.
  - Approves the liquidity pair for maximum trading flexibility.
  - Enables swapping and trading functionalities.

### 5.2 Liquidity Provision

- **Uniswap Integration:** HAIR leverages Uniswap V2 for decentralized trading, ensuring liquidity and facilitating seamless swaps.

- **Liquidity Allocation:** Upon enabling trading, a significant portion of HAIR tokens and ETH are allocated to the liquidity pool, stabilizing the token's market presence.

## 6. Anti-Whale Measures

To promote fairness and prevent market manipulation, HAIR implements anti-whale mechanisms that limit large transactions and holdings.

### 6.1 Maximum Transaction Limit

- **Max Transaction Amount:** Initially set to **2,000,000 HAIR**.

- **Purpose:** Prevents large single transactions that could significantly impact the token's price, ensuring stability and fairness for all participants.

### 6.2 Maximum Wallet Size

- **Max Wallet Size:** Initially set to **2,000,000 HAIR**.

- **Purpose:** Restricts any single wallet from holding more than 2% of the total supply, mitigating the risk of centralized control and potential market manipulation.

---

## 7. Utility Functions

HAIR incorporates various utility functions to enhance user experience, promote community engagement, and ensure operational efficiency.

### 7.1 Airdrop Mechanism

- **Airdrop Functionality:** Allows the owner or sentinels to distribute HAIR tokens to multiple wallets simultaneously.

- **Parameters:**
  - **Wallet List:** Up to 200 wallets can be airdropped in a single transaction.
  - **Amounts:** Variable amounts can be specified for each wallet, facilitating customized distributions.

- **Purpose:** Encourages community growth, rewards loyal holders, and fosters widespread adoption through strategic token distribution.

### 7.2 Manual Operations

- **Manual Send:** Allows the owner or sentinels to transfer accumulated ETH from the contract to the marketing wallet, ensuring timely funding for marketing activities.

- **Manual Swap:** Enables the conversion of accumulated HAIR tokens within the contract to ETH, facilitating the allocation of funds to designated wallets.

These manual operations provide flexibility in managing the token's funds, ensuring responsiveness to market conditions and operational needs.
